To run the tests, you will first need to have [gobble-cli](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble-cli) installed:

```bash
npm install -g gobble-cli
```

Then:

```bash
# if you're not already here...
cd simulant/test

# open your browser and fire up a webserver
open http://localhost:4567 && gobble
```
